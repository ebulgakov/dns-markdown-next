    "text": "<lead>This is an unofficial website of the DNS company. This site helps you browse discounted goods from various cities listed on the DNS website.</lead>\n\nThe service provides a convenient way to browse products from Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Samara, and Yekaterinburg. You can add items to your favorites to track updates, such as price changes or store availability.\n\nThe service offers the option to subscribe via email for daily price list updates for your city of interest, as well as receive email notifications regarding changes to your favorite items.\n\n<border>One of the main features of the site is price analysis. For every product in every city, a snapshot of the price/benefit/initial price is created and presented to the user in a convenient graph. The price analysis clearly shows when the item you are interested in has dropped in price and is ready to be purchased.</border>\n\nAnother important feature is the ability to add items from several different cities to your favorites and track their updates; if you or any of your friends or relatives happen to be in that city, they can purchase the item for you.\n\nYou can also select categories that do not interest you, and they will be collapsed while browsing the price list so they dont interfere with your viewing experience.\n\nAnd of course, the main reason for all of this is the ability to view the entire price list without a \"Show more\" button. All products are displayed at once with \"Live Search.\" This means you dont need to reload the page to see search results; products will appear as soon as you start typing your query.\n\nThe next handy feature is a daily archive for each city. This can be very useful when you need to see which products were available yesterday or a week ago.\n\nFinally, one of the key capabilities is hourly updates. This is a convenient way to track new arrivals, price changes, and deals for the current day as of the latest hour.",
